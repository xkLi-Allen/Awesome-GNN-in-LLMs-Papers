With the proliferation of cross-task and cross-domain textual attribute graphs, the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pivotal approach to addressing complex graph data problems. Using a novel classification framework based on the three core elements of machine learning—data, model, and downstream task—we systematically categorize and summarize current tasks. Through this approach, we provide a structured review of existing GRAPH-LLM advancements across diverse domains and tasks, analyzing data types, model architectures, and their performance in various applications.
